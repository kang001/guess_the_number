Part 1:

Follow the instructions with the slides to create an example repository, use the log, reflog, status, and reset commands.

What's HEAD?
The most recent commit

What's the log, and the reflog? How are the two different?
Log - is a list of commits
Reflog - a detailed list of all commits, branch checkouts, merges, and resets
The difference between the two is that a reflog will let you reference a specific commit

What does HEAD@{4} mean?
This references a specific commit that you can reset or rollback to directly
